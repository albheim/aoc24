# Advent of Code 2024
This year I will try to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org) while saving Christmas.

I'm using zig version 0.13.0 so not guaranteed to work with other versions.

## Running the code
Running a day should be
```
zig build run -- X
```
where `X` is they day, and running tests for the day should be
```
zig test src/dayXX.zig
```

## Timing
TODO some vague desire to get it to all run below 1 second total
