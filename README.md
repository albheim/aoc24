# Advent of Code 2024
This year I will try to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org) while saving Christmas.

I'm using zig version 0.13.0 so not guaranteed to work with other versions.

## Running the code
Running the main input for day `XX`:
```
zig build run-XX
```
Running tests for day `XX`:
```
zig build test-XX
```
Running timing for day `XX`:
```
zig build time-XX
```

Running the commands without `-XX` will run it for all days.
